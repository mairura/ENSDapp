# ENSDapp
#Tech Stack Used
 - ReactJS
 - Solidity & Hardhat 
 - Ethers
 - IPFS Filecoin for NFT storage

# Use Case
A Dapp that allows one to set up a domain name for their website in that it stores the domain name in an NFT which point out to their website.

Profitability
This reduces the cost of paying for a domain either monthly or annually. 
One is only able to pay for deployment gas and a small fee for the NFT.

# How it works
It supports crypto connection to any chain of choise.
Whenever one is connected, they are able to set up there domain names which have a prefix extention according to the deployed smart contract.
That can also change according to diffrent preferences and redeployment of the smart contract.

#Future Plans
Implement buying and selling of NFT domain names and change ownership from seller to buyer.
