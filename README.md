# Tech Stack Used
 - ReactJS
 - Solidity & Hardhat 
 - Ethers
 - IPFS Filecoin for NFT storage

# Use Case
A Dapp that allows one to set up a domain name for their website in that it stores the domain name in an NFT which point out to their website.

Profitability
- This reduces the cost of paying for a domain either monthly or annually. 
- One is only able to pay for deployment gas and a small fee for the NFT.
- There is no fear of domain getting blocked down as it stored permanetly on the blockchain.

# How it works
It supports crypto connection to any chain of choise. but preferably we consider polygon.
Whenever one is connected, they are able to set up there domain names which have a prefix extention according to the deployed smart contract.
Because people tend to forget there domain names we set up a hint name to there domains.
One is able to see there transactions ongoing on mumbai testnet by clicking on the domain name minted.
We also set a reset for the domain name in that inacase one wants to update there domain name, they can do it by clicking the pencil icon and this would simply set them to change there domain name.
